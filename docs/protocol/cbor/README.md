# Frank deterministic CBOR, version 1

Status: normative for the codec proof in issues #131 and #182. Production
protocols do not use this format until their separate migration tickets land.

The words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, and MAY are normative as described by RFC 2119. Numbered rules are stable references for implementations and test
vectors.

## 1. Framing

An independently stored, signed, hashed, forwarded, or opaquely embedded Frank
object is exactly one frame:

| Offset | Size | Field                                              |
| -----: | ---: | -------------------------------------------------- |
|      0 |    4 | ASCII `FRNK` (`46 52 4e 4b`)                       |
|      4 |    1 | Frame version, `01`                                |
|      5 |    4 | CBOR body length as an unsigned big-endian integer |
|      9 |    N | The exact deterministic-CBOR envelope bytes        |

F1. A version-1 reader MUST compare the magic before interpreting any CBOR.

F2. A reader MUST reject an unsupported frame version. A storage or forwarding
boundary that explicitly permits unknown versions MAY retain the complete
frame opaquely, but MUST NOT interpret it as version 1.

F3. The declared body length MUST equal all bytes remaining after the nine-byte
header. Truncation, concatenated frames, and trailing bytes MUST reject.

F4. The applicable frame-size limit MUST be checked before allocating or
decoding the body.

F5. Failure of magic, version, length, CBOR, schema, or semantic validation
MUST NOT trigger protobuf, JSON, BCS, or other codec fallback.

F6. The complete frame, including its nine-byte header, is the byte identity
used by the transcripts in section 8. The magic is recognition, not
authentication.

Decision #181 owns this framing. Typed maps nested inside a frame are ordinary
CBOR. A nested object is framed only when it has its own type/version and exact
bytes, or is independently stored, signed, hashed, forwarded, or interpreted
after its parent.

## 2. Common envelope

The body is the `frank-envelope` map in [common.cddl](common.cddl):

| Key | Name                 | Meaning                                                |
| --: | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|   0 | `type_id`            | Immutable object-kind identifier                       |
|   1 | `schema_version`     | Exact schema revision written                          |
|   2 | `min_reader_version` | Oldest semantic reader allowed to interpret it         |
|   3 | `payload`            | One complete canonical-CBOR data item in a byte string |

E1. All four keys are required. Other envelope keys are forbidden in version

1. Additive evolution occurs inside the payload or in a later frame version.

E2. `schema_version` and `min_reader_version` begin at 1. A reader MUST NOT
interpret an object when its supported semantic-reader version is less than
`min_reader_version`. `min_reader_version` MUST NOT exceed `schema_version`.

E3. `payload` MUST contain exactly one data item satisfying section 3. A known
type additionally applies its CDDL and semantic rules. An unknown type or
schema MAY be retained and forwarded only as the original complete frame.

E4. A forwarder MUST NOT decode and re-encode a signed, hashed, committed, or
unknown object. Successful validation does not authorize reconstruction.

E5. Type identifiers are never reused. Version 1 reserves:

|    Type ID | Name                                       | Schema                                     |
| ---------: | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
|          1 | Recipient-specific direct-message delivery | [direct-message.cddl](direct-message.cddl) |
|          2 | Signed directory attestation               | [directory.cddl](directory.cddl)           |
|          3 | Mailbox checkpoint                         | [checkpoint.cddl](checkpoint.cddl)         |
|          4 | Directory statement signed by type 2       | [directory.cddl](directory.cddl)           |
|          5 | Recipient-encrypted payload                | [direct-message.cddl](direct-message.cddl) |
|          6 | Decrypted message content                  | [direct-message.cddl](direct-message.cddl) |
|          7 | Key-transition statement                   | [directory.cddl](directory.cddl)           |
|          8 | Plaintext message-content revision         | [direct-message.cddl](direct-message.cddl) |
|         16 | Container message item                     | [direct-message.cddl](direct-message.cddl) |
|         17 | UTF-8 text message item                    | [direct-message.cddl](direct-message.cddl) |
| 0xffff0001 | Proof-only unknown future message item     | Opaque fixture payload                     |

Unassigned identifiers remain reserved and MUST NOT be emitted. The proof-only
identifier MUST NOT appear in a production writer; it remains permanently
reserved so the unknown-item vector never acquires a different meaning.

## 3. Restricted deterministic-CBOR profile

C1. Maps use the RFC 8949 section 4.2.1 bytewise lexicographic order of each
key's deterministic encoding. Integer keys are required for extensible
protocol records. Because version 1 map keys are unsigned integers in their
shortest encoding, their encoded-byte order is also deterministic across
implementations.

C2. Integers and lengths MUST use their shortest preferred encoding. A value
that fits in the additional-information field or a smaller integer argument
MUST NOT use a larger representation.

C3. All byte strings, text strings, arrays, and maps MUST have definite length.

C4. Map keys MUST be unique and already sorted. A decoder MUST reject a
duplicate or out-of-order key rather than accepting a last value.

C5. Unsigned integers, negative integers, byte strings, UTF-8 text strings,
arrays, maps, `false`, `true`, and `null` are the only permitted CBOR data
items. Floats, simple values other than those three, tags, `undefined`, break
codes, and indefinite collections MUST reject.

C6. Text MUST be well-formed shortest-form UTF-8. Surrogates, overlong
sequences, and invalid continuation bytes MUST reject. Protocol identifiers
that a schema marks ASCII MUST contain only bytes `20` through `7e` unless that
schema narrows them further.

C7. A declared `u64` is in `0..18446744073709551615`; a declared `i64` is in
`-9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807`. TypeScript implementations MUST
expose these as `bigint`, never `number`.

C8. Values wider than 64 bits are fixed-width big-endian byte strings whose
width is declared by the schema. Leading zero bytes remain significant. No
bignum tag is permitted. Version-1 EVM quantities use exactly 32 bytes.

C9. Decoding MUST consume the entire envelope body and the entire payload data
item. Trailing data rejects at both levels.

C10. Canonical validation precedes typed conversion. An implementation may use
a streaming validator or compare validated input with an independent canonical
re-encoding over this restricted value set; permissive library defaults are
not the protocol.

C11. Source map insertion order MUST NOT affect encoded output. A protocol set
MUST be represented as a list sorted by its declared semantic key and MUST
reject duplicate semantic keys.

## 4. Resource limits

The limits below are part of version 1, not recommendations. A narrower route
or object limit MAY reject earlier but MUST NOT accept an object exceeding the
global limits.

| Constant                |                                 Value | Applies to                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MAX_FRAME_BYTES`       | 8,388,617 (8 MiB body + 9-byte frame) | Complete frame                                          |
| `MAX_BODY_BYTES`        |                     8,388,608 (8 MiB) | Envelope CBOR body                                      |
| `MAX_DEPTH`             |                                    32 | Nested CBOR arrays/maps, including envelope and payload |
| `MAX_CONTAINERS`        |                                16,384 | Arrays plus maps in one frame                           |
| `MAX_ITEMS`             |                                65,536 | Scalars plus containers in one validation operation     |
| `MAX_MAP_ENTRIES`       |                                   256 | Entries in any one map                                  |
| `MAX_ARRAY_ELEMENTS`    |                                 8,192 | Elements in any one array                               |
| `MAX_BYTE_STRING_BYTES` |                             8,388,608 | Any byte string before type-specific limits             |
| `MAX_TEXT_STRING_BYTES` |                     262,144 (256 KiB) | Any UTF-8 text string                                   |

R1. Counters include values inside the payload byte string after it is opened
for canonical validation. When a schema causes nested frames to be opened, one
shared validation budget accumulates their bytes, depth, containers, and total
items; a child parser MUST NOT reset the parent's counters. Implementations
MUST fail without partially returning a typed object when any limit is
exceeded.

R2. The direct-message frame limit is 1 MiB, with at most 256 message items
total across the recursively opened item graph, 64 payment members, and 512 KiB
in one encrypted payload. This deliberately permits messages larger than 64
KiB while requiring large media to be chunked or referenced rather than
embedded without bound.

R3. The directory-attestation frame limit is 256 KiB, with at most 32 relay
bindings and 16 signatures.

R4. The checkpoint frame may use the global 8 MiB limit, with at most 4,096
journal facts or opaque sections. Larger state exports MUST be chunked into
independently framed checkpoints.

R5. Lengths and aggregate counters MUST be checked using arithmetic that cannot
wrap. A limit error is distinct from malformed, non-canonical, unsupported, and
schema errors as defined by the vector manifest.

## 5. Semantic ordering and uniqueness

S1. Network tags are lowercase ASCII identifiers matching
`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{0,63}`. Network tags are protocol data, not URL path
components.

S1a. Numeric values compare by mathematical value. Byte strings compare
lexicographically by unsigned byte value. Text strings compare
lexicographically by their exact UTF-8 bytes. Tuples compare the first unequal
component using its declared comparator; a shorter otherwise-equal byte/text
string sorts first. Language-native locale or UTF-16 ordering MUST NOT be used.

S2. An account reference is ordered by `(key_type, key_bytes)`. Key type is an
allocated unsigned identifier, not an inference from byte length. Version 1
allocates key type 1 to 33-byte compressed SEC1 secp256k1 public keys, 2 to
32-byte Ed25519 public keys, and 3 to 32-byte x-only secp256k1 public keys.

S2a. Version 1 allocates signature algorithm 1 to strict-DER, low-S secp256k1
ECDSA over the 32-byte SHA-256 transcript digest; 2 to BIP340 Schnorr over that
digest, including BIP340's tagged challenge construction; and 16 to RFC 8032
Ed25519 over the complete common transcript. Algorithm 3 is reserved for a
future reviewed BCH-style Schnorr profile and MUST reject until that profile
freezes its distinct challenge construction. Signatures from algorithms 2 and
3 are never interchangeable merely because both use secp256k1.

S2b. Algorithm 1 requires key type 1 and a strict-DER signature of 8 through 72
bytes; algorithm 2 requires key type 3 and exactly 64 signature bytes; algorithm
16 requires key type 2 and exactly 64 signature bytes. Any other
algorithm/key-type/length combination is unsupported, not a signature failure.

S2c. Encryption-suite identifier 65535 is reserved for opaque proof-vector
ciphertext and MUST NOT be emitted by a production writer. Production suites
are allocated only with their nonce, key-agreement, authentication/deniability,
and failure rules. The codec does not infer a suite from nonce length.

S3. Payment members are ordered by numeric `child_index`, then bytewise
`transaction_id`. Child indices and transaction identifiers MUST each be
independently unique. Child indices are non-hardened BIP32 indices in
`0..2147483647`. Amounts need not be equal. Independently verified values are
added with checked unsigned 256-bit arithmetic; overflow rejects. Their sum
MUST be greater than or equal to the applicable minimum. Each encoded amount
MUST exactly equal the independently observed value in its verified chain
transaction; an encoded assertion is never payment evidence by itself.

S4. Relay bindings are ordered by bytewise `relay_id`, then UTF-8-bytewise
`endpoint`, and unique by `relay_id`. Endpoints are exact opaque ASCII URI
strings for signing, equality, and ordering: the codec performs no case,
default-port, percent-escape, Unicode-host, or trailing-slash normalization. A
consumer separately validates allowed schemes before use. Signatures are
ordered by numeric `algorithm`, numeric `signer_key_type`, then bytewise
`signer_key_bytes`, and unique by that complete tuple.

S4a. Offline recovery authorities are ordered by numeric key type, then
bytewise key bytes, and unique by that complete account-reference tuple. A
transition may use only an authority present in the last accepted statement,
not one introduced by the statement being authorized.

S5. Key transitions are ordered by the numeric revision, numeric new-key type,
and bytewise new-key bytes parsed from their type-7 statement frame. Two
transitions with the same revision are invalid rather than tie-broken.

S6. Checkpoint journal facts are ordered by numeric `(seconds, nanoseconds)`,
then bytewise `fact_id`. Timestamps do not create identity: `fact_id` remains
the stable tiebreaker and MUST be independently unique within a checkpoint.

S7. Opaque checkpoint sections are ordered by numeric `(section_type,
schema_version)` and MUST have independently unique `section_type` values.

S8. A type-1 delivery's network and destination account MUST equal the opened
type-5 payload's network and recipient account. After decryption, type 6's
network MUST also equal type 5's network, and its T1a digest MUST equal its
opened type-8 revision frame. Message-item array order is authored semantic
order, not a set to be resorted.

## 6. Fixture schemas and identity boundaries

The CDDL files describe the three proof families required by #131. CDDL cannot
express framing, canonical byte order, regexes, aggregate limits, cross-field
equality, or cryptographic validation; the numbered prose rules remain
normative.

### Direct messages and recursive items

The type-1 delivery contains one type-5 recipient-encrypted-payload frame, its
T3 digest, and a sorted payment set. The decrypted plaintext of type 5 is a
complete type-6 message-content frame. One valid payment member is
permitted when the wallet cannot economically source the preferred two or more.
`message_id`, the type-8 plaintext revision frame, and its T1a content digest
belong inside encrypted content; they are not relay-visible delivery identity.
Each recipient may therefore have different encrypted bytes and a different
payload digest for the same logical message.

A type-16 container message item holds complete child frames as byte strings;
type 17 is a text item. Unknown item types remain exact child-frame bytes. The
proof fixture MUST contain at least two levels and the permanently reserved
proof-only unknown type `0xffff0001`.

Direct-message stamps are payments to recipient-derived addresses. They are not
burns. A payment member commits to this recipient-specific encrypted-payload
frame and its distinct child index, so an existing transaction cannot authorize
a different payload.

### Directory attestations

Type 4 is the complete framed statement. Type 2 wraps that exact frame and a
sorted signature set, avoiding a signature-containing-itself cycle. A
signature authenticates the complete type-4 frame through section 8. Every
attestation MUST contain a verified signature whose signer exactly equals the
statement subject, proving possession of the claimed current key. A bootstrap
record needs no predecessor. If an update changes the currently registered
subject, it additionally needs a valid T2a transition authorized by the prior
key or a registered offline recovery authority. Merely carrying a valid
signature from an unrelated key never authorizes a directory record. The proof
fixture contains two relay bindings, `u64::MAX` revision, and a seconds plus
nanoseconds timestamp.

### Mailbox checkpoints

Type 3 records a checkpoint identity, ordered journal facts, and sorted opaque
extension sections. A tombstone is a durable fact, not physical deletion. Each
opaque section value is a complete frame when its advertised kind is a Frank
object. The proof fixture contains an unknown section and an unknown nested
message item whose exact bytes survive every round trip.

## 7. Evolution and retention

V1. Adding an optional integer-keyed payload field increments
`schema_version`. It need not raise `min_reader_version` when the older reader
can safely process the known projection while retaining the original frame.

V2. Changing cryptographic meaning, validation, identity, ordering, or a
required field raises `min_reader_version`. Existing frames never change
meaning retroactively.

V3. An implementation that does not understand a type, schema, field, message
item, key algorithm, or extension MAY retain it only when its containing
contract explicitly allows opaque retention. It MUST NOT report unsupported
semantics as verified.

V4. Exact retention means preserving every byte of the original complete
frame. Re-encoding an equivalent data model is not retention.

V5. Existing protobuf and JSON objects are never relabeled or transcoded into
the same identity. A later migration uses explicit routes/content types or a
bounded version transition. Hostile bytes are never codec-guessed.

V6. After generic validation, a reader applies this mandatory decision:

1. Unknown `type_id`, unsupported frame version, or
   `min_reader_version > reader_version`: opaque retention only where the
   containing contract permits it; otherwise reject as unsupported.
2. Known type and `schema_version <= highest_supported_schema`: interpret the
   exact supported schema, retaining the original frame alongside the typed
   projection.
3. Known type, newer `schema_version`, and
   `min_reader_version <= reader_version`: interpret only fields defined by the
   reader's highest supported schema, retain unknown fields plus the original
   frame, and never reconstruct that frame for forwarding or verification.

An application MUST NOT claim that unknown semantics were verified. This
decision is identical in TypeScript and Rust.

## 8. Cryptographic transcripts

All lengths below are unsigned big-endian integers. `utf8(x)` is the exact UTF-8
encoding of the already schema-validated string; the transcript performs no
additional normalization. `frame` is the complete bytes from section 1.
Concatenation is written `||`.

The common transcript is:

```text
u16be(len(domain)) || ascii(domain)
|| u16be(len(network_tag)) || utf8(network_tag)
|| u32be(len(frame)) || frame
|| context
```

T1. The content hash is SHA-256 of the common transcript with domain
`frank/content-hash/v1` and empty context.

T1a. A stable plaintext `content_digest` is SHA-256 of the common transcript
with domain `frank/message-content/v1`, where `frame` is the complete type-8
message-content-revision frame and context is empty. The type-8 frame excludes
recipient encryption and logical `message_id`, so recipient fanout preserves
content identity while edits produce a new digest. Its transcript network tag
is the literal `frank`, matching the type-8 field, so a composite message's
logical content remains independent of which settlement rail delivered it;
individual chain-bearing entries retain their own network tags.

T2. A directory signature uses the common transcript with domain
`frank/directory-signature/v1`, where `frame` is the complete type-4 directory
statement frame. Algorithms 1 and 2 sign its 32-byte SHA-256 digest; algorithm
16 signs the transcript bytes directly as required by S2a. The algorithm
identifier lives in the type-2 signature entry and selects its exact
signing/verification rules. Schnorr identifiers distinguish BIP340 from
BCH-style Schnorr and other incompatible challenge hashes. `context` is empty.

T2a. A key-transition authorization uses the common transcript with domain
`frank/key-transition-signature/v1`, where `frame` is the complete type-7
key-transition-statement frame and the network argument MUST equal its network
field. The statement binds the directory subject, prior authority, revision,
and new key. The signature entry outside that frame names the algorithm; its
signer MUST exactly equal `prior_authority`, and that authority MUST be the
currently registered key or a separately registered offline recovery authority.
`context` is empty.

T3. The recipient payload digest used as the stamp stealth root is SHA-256 of
the common transcript with domain `frank/recipient-payload/v1`, where `frame`
is the complete type-5 recipient-encrypted-payload frame and context is empty.
The accepted #60 derivation then adds this digest as a secp256k1 scalar to the
recipient public key and derives the non-hardened BIP32 path
`m/44/145/child_index/0`; this codec does not redesign that math. As in #60,
zero or a value greater than or equal to the secp256k1 group order rejects
rather than reducing modulo the order; a sender constructs fresh encrypted
payload bytes instead.

T4. Each payment member's on-chain commitment is
`SHA256(ascii("frank:dm-stamp-payment:v1") || T3_digest ||
u32be(child_index))`. The exact 32-byte value MUST be present in the verified
transaction commitment field and field 4 of that payment member. A missing or
different value rejects. Changing the payload frame, network, versions, or
child index therefore prevents transaction reuse for another message. Relay
delivery fees use a separate domain and are not part of this transcript.

T5. Protocol signatures and commitments MUST bind the network tag passed to
the transcript and MUST confirm it equals the frame's typed network field.

T6. A one-byte change anywhere in a bound frame changes the transcript. The
golden-vector proof MUST demonstrate changed hashes and failed verification;
canonical encoding alone is not authentication.

## 9. Validation order

A version-1 implementation validates in this order:

1. Caller-supplied route/object byte limit.
2. Minimum header length and magic.
3. Frame version.
4. Declared length, global length, and exact input exhaustion.
5. Restricted-CBOR syntax, canonicality, and global resource counters for the
   envelope.
6. Exact common-envelope keys and scalar ranges.
7. Restricted-CBOR syntax, canonicality, and shared resource counters for the
   payload and recursively opened child frames.
8. Known-type schema and per-type resource limits.
9. Semantic ordering, uniqueness, cross-field, network, and digest checks.
10. Signature, payment, or other cryptographic verification.

No stage may consume funds, mark a payment used, advance a mailbox cursor, or
persist an interpreted record before every applicable later stage succeeds.

## 10. Vector manifest

[vectors.schema.json](vectors.schema.json) defines the committed corpus index.
Every case names its source implementation, complete frame hex, expected stable
error category, and normative rules. Positive vectors additionally name the
type/schema and expected content hash. Hostile vectors retain their bytes even
when parsing fails so both implementations test the same input.

The positive type-1 direct-message case MUST also record
`content_digest_hex`, `payload_digest_hex`, and every
`payment_commitments_hex` value. Implementations compare those outputs with T1a,
T3, T4, the encoded payment member, and the simulated verifier-visible
transaction commitment.

Stable error categories are: `frame`, `unsupported`, `resource`, `malformed`,
`noncanonical`, `schema`, `semantic`, and `cryptographic`. Public APIs may give
more detail but MUST preserve this cross-language category. When bytes violate
multiple rules, the validation order in section 9 selects the first category;
implementations MUST NOT continue merely to report a later failure. Within CBOR
validation, malformed syntax precedes canonicality, resource counters fail at
the first item that exceeds the shared budget, and typed schema checks follow a
fully valid canonical item.

Vector case IDs MUST be unique. `paired_case`, when present, MUST name a
different existing case, be reciprocal, and indicate two cases whose
relationship is asserted by their descriptions (for example, an accepted frame
and its one-byte cryptographic mutation). Dangling, self, one-way, and duplicate
pairs make the manifest invalid even though JSON Schema cannot express these
cross-record constraints.
